# 🔐 Secure TLS 1.3 Messaging App with Digital Signatures

This project demonstrates a **secure messaging application** simulating a **TLS 1.3 handshake**, including:

- **ECDHE key exchange** for perfect forward secrecy
- **Digital signatures** for handshake and message authentication
- **Session key derivation using HKDF**
- **Encrypted messaging** with AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305

> ⚠️ Note: This is a **learning/demo implementation** and not production-grade TLS.

## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- `cryptography` library
- `pickle` (built-in)
- `os` (built-in)
- `threading` (built-in)

> Optional: x25519 support is included in the `cryptography` library

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install cryptography
````

## 🚀 Setup & Usage

### 1. Clone or download the repository

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <project_directory>
```

### 2. Start the server

```bash
python server.py
```

* Server listens on `localhost:8443`
* Generates ephemeral ECDHE keys, RSA keys, and a self-signed certificate

### 3. Start the client

```bash
python client.py
```

* Connects to server and performs TLS 1.3-style handshake
* Derives session key and verifies handshake signatures
* Enters **encrypted chat mode**

### 4. Chat

* Type messages in the client terminal to send encrypted messages
* Server prints decrypted messages and verifies signatures
* Sequence numbers prevent replay attacks

---

## ⚙ How It Works

### Handshake

1. Client sends `ClientHello` (supported cipher suites + ECDHE public key)
2. Server sends `ServerHello` + certificate + signature
3. Both derive shared secret via **ECDHE**
4. Session key derived with **HKDF**
5. Client and server exchange **Finished messages** (HMAC over handshake)

### Encrypted Messaging

* Messages encrypted with **AES-GCM** (or ChaCha20-Poly1305) using session key
* Messages signed with **RSA-PSS**
* Server verifies signatures and sends acknowledgement

### Security Features

* Ephemeral ECDHE for **Perfect Forward Secrecy**
* RSA signatures for **authentication**
* HKDF for session key derivation
* Sequence numbers for **replay attack prevention**

## 📝 Notes

* Self-signed certificates are used for demo purposes; there is no CA validation
* Cipher suites negotiation is simplified
* This project is designed for **learning and demonstration of TLS 1.3 concepts**
* **Not recommended for production use**
